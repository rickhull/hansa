A _League_ is made up of _Cities_

City:
  - population
  - production function
  - utility function

Production function:
  - prod(_labor_) yields a _good_
  - L labor units produce 1 good unit
  - N good units require L * N labor units
  - labor cost varies between goods and cities
  - labor cost is partly but not entirely determined by surrounding terrain

Utility function:
  - util(_goods_consumed_) yields utils
  - total happiness of inhabitants; depends on goods consumed
  - The additional utility from consuming one more unit of a good decreases as
    the amount of that good consumed increases and increases as the amount of
    any other good increases
  - identical across cities
  - autarky level: highest utility achieved *without trade*

Trade:
  - transportation requires labor, provided by the exporting city
  - transportation costs vary between cities (distance, water / land)
  - transportation is instant (every turn represents 1 year)

Gameplay:
  - Production / Consumption / Trade
  - Allocate labor towards production of specific goods
  - Allocate production towards consumption or trade (export)
  - No storage, so Consumption is: Production + Imports - Exports
